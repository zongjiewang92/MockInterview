My responsibilities included implementing recall mechanisms and \nrecommendation algorithms to ensure high -quality candidate recommendations. The project \naimed to achieve seamless dual end  matching to improve conversion rates for both ends. I \nimplemented a scalable distributed architecture using the Spring framework and built a highly \navailable architecture with Zookeeper. By consuming real -time data from Kafka, we ensured the \ntimeliness and accuracy of the word packages. At the underlying level, we used Elasticsearch to \ncreate text indices for search and matching, supplemented by Redis for real -time traffic data \nqueries, and Hadoop for backup storage of historical word package records.  \nTechnologies:   \nC, Python, Java, Kafka, Zookeeper, Spring Framework,  Redis, Elasticsearch,  Hadoop, Hive, \nMyBatis, MySQL, Maven, Git, Linux  \n\u25fc Project: ABTest  \nIntroduction:   \nThis project catered to the internal algorithm team at BOSS direct employment, leveraging the \nAB experimental platform  to facilitate rapid iteration of algorithmic strategies.  As a Senior \nSoftware Developer , my responsibilities included orchestrating the seamless integration of \nvarious modules such as request sorting, policy configuration, data printing, log distribution, \nplug-in management, and effect statistics.  This integration encompassed all stages of the \nrecommendation process, enabling agile and effective algorithmic strategies.  Utilizing \nadvanced technologies such as Kafka for real -time data processing and Zookeeper for \ndistributed coordination, we ensured robust support for the entire recommendation business.  \nMy role encompassed designing and implementing scalable, high -performance systems, \naligning with business objectives to drive innovation and enhance user experience.  \nTechnologies:   \nKafka, Zookeeper, Spring Framework, MyBatis, MySQL, Maven, Git , Shell , Hive \n  Intermediate   Engineer     Suning Nanjing, China    June 2016 \u2013 Sep 2018 \n \n\u25fc Project: Data Integration  \nIntroduction:   \nThe Data Integration project stands as a primary initiative within the Suning Data Cloud system, \ndedicated to furnishing comprehensive data  ETL services  across the entire Suning industry \nchain.
